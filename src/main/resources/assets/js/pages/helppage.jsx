          <h3>Performing federated search in corpora</h3>
          <p>To perform a simple keyword search in all CLARIN Federated Content Search centres
            and their corpora, go to the search field at the top of the page or switch to Text Layer Contextual Query Language (CQL) in the dropdown list,
            enter your query, and click the 'search' button or press the 'Enter' key.</p>
          <p>To perform an advanced search on multiple annotation layers in CLARIN Federated Content Search centres that support this, switch to Multi-layer Federated Content Search (FCS-QL) in the dropdown list, create the query in the Graphical Query Builder, and click the 'search' button or press the 'Enter' key. Alternatively in embedded mode enter a FCS-QL query in the search field at the top of the page.</p>

          <p>When the search starts, the page will start filling in with the corpora responses.
            After the entire search process has ended you have the option to download the results
            in various formats.
          </p>

          <p>If you are particularly interested in the results returned by a corpus, you have
            the option to focus only on the results of that corpus, by clicking on the 'Watch' button.
            In this view mode you can also download the results of use the WebLicht processing services
            to further analyse the results.</p>


          <h3>Adjusting search criteria</h3>
          <p>The FCS Aggregator makes possible to select specific corpora based on their name
            or language and to specify the number of search results (hits) per corpus per page.
            The user interface controls that allows to change these options are located
            right below the search fiels on the main page. The current options are
            to filter resources based on their language, to select specific resources, and
            to set the maximum number of hits. In the multi-layer FCS search the supported layers filter on the supported features like, e. g. part of speech or lemma in addition to the other filter options.</p>


          <h3>More help</h3>
          <p>More detailed information on using FCS Aggregator is available at the &nbsp;

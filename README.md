# FCS-SRU-Aggregator
CLARIN Federated Content Search v3.0 Aggregator â€“ Augmenting your Search Engine

## Introduction
The CLARIN Federated Content Search (CLARIN-FCS) introduces an _interface specification_ that
decouples the _search engine_ functionality from its _exploitation_, i.e. user-interfaces,
third-party applications, to allow services to access heterogeneous search engines in a uniform way.

## The Aggregator
[The Aggregator v3.0](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/ws/fcs/2.0/aggregator/) is running at
[The National Swedish Language Bank's text division](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/)
as well as at [CLARIN](https://contentsearch.clarin.eu/).

## The Specification
The Specification for Federated Content Search v2.0 can be found as a
[PDF document](https://office.clarin.eu/v/CE-2017-1046-FCS-Specification-v89.pdf).
For more details visit at the [CLARIN FCS - Technical Details](https://www.clarin.eu/content/federated-content-search-clarin-fcs-technical-details) page.

## Updates
For a detailed list of changes, please take a look at [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

### What is new in FCS Aggregator v3.0?
* A new graphical query builder (GQB) to support  the new Query Language FCS-QL
* Support for the AdvancedDataView, ADV, with layer capabilities
* Backwards compatibility to earlier versions of Endpoints and protocols, _legacy_ and _version1_

The backwards compatibility gives you as a Centre search engine maintainer a smooth transtion
to the new features and capabilities at your own convenience.

### What is new in FCS v2.0?
* A new Query Language
* A matching display of query results, the AdvancedDataView, ADV, with layer capabilities
* Backwards compatibility to earlier versions

These new additions to the CLARIN-FCS will not only enhance the power user experience and
possibilities when performing queries from repositories, but also that less experienced
users will find it easier to explore different corpora.

## How does it work?
1. a _Client_ submits a query to an _Endpoint_
2. The _Endpoint_ translates the query from CQL or FCS-QL to the query dialect used by the _Search Engine_ and submits the translated query to the _Search Engine_
3. The _Search Engine_ processes the query and generates a result set, i.e. it compiles a set of hits that match the search criteria.
4. The _Endpoint_ then translates the results from the Search Engine-specific result set format to the CLARIN-FCS result format and sends them to the _Client_.

## Endpoint Reference Implementation
If you have any kind of RESTful API to your Search Engine using the
[Korp Endpoint Reference Implementation](https://github.com/clarin-eric/fcs-korp-endpoint/) as a
starting point should be the way to go. If you more specifically are using Korp it should only be
a simple adaptation to corpora and tagsets needed. In any case do not forget to look at the tests.

## Endpoint Tester
To test your Endpoint you can point the [IDS Endpoint Tester](http://clarin.ids-mannheim.de/srutest) to your Endpoint.

## Endpoint developer's tutorial
There is also an Endpoint developer's tutorial available.

## Building
To build the FCS Aggregator you need a few simple steps (if you have not changed anything just skip to step 3):
1. `./build.sh --npm`
2. `./build.sh --jsx`
3. `./build.sh --jar`

The frontend (React) and backend (jersey servlet) are then built using node and maven.

## Running
Check the `aggregator_devel.yml` configuration file. If you want to sideload your enpoint simply
add the endpoint to either `additionalCQLEndpoints` or `additionalFCSEndpoints` before running:

`./build.sh --run`

you might also want to change the path to your cache files in `AGGREGATOR_FILE_PATH` and `AGGREGATOR_FILE_PATH_BACKUP` respectively.

You then can access the locally running Aggregator at [http://localhost:4019/](http://localhost:4019/)

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for example deployment configurations.

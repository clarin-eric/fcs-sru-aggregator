The European Science Foundation Second Language Acquisition by Adult Immigrants collected spontaneous second language acquisition data of forty adult immigrant workers living in Western Europe. The program ran over 5 Â½ years and was preceded by a one-year pilot study. It had been planned as a longitudinal comparative study in five European countries: France, (Federal Republic of) Germany, Great Britain, The Netherlands, and Sweden. Financial support came from the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Germany) and the research councils of France (CNRS), The Netherlands (NWO), Switzerland (FNS), and Norway (NAVS).

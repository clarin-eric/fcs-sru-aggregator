HEMPEL
https://clarin.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/BASRepository/Public/Corpora/HEMPEL/HEMPEL.2.php
Hempels Sofa is a collection of more than 3900 spontaneous speech items recorded as extra material during the German SpeechDat-II project. Speakers were asked to report what they had been doing during the last hour: Was haben Sie in der letzten Stunde gemacht?. This item was recorded as the last item of the recording session. Speakers had become acquainted with the recording procedure and they were quite relaxed because they knew that this item was the last to be recorded. This resulted in quite natural, colloquial speech, sometimes with marked regional accent. The corpus collection is described in more detail in the LREC2002 paper Three New Corpora at the Bavarian Archive for Speech Signals - and a First Step Towards Distributed Web-Based Recording by C. Draxler and F. Schiel. This paper is contained in this database in file DOC/BASCORPO.PDF; it also contains links to related SpeechDat documents. Note: the name of the corpus refers to the German proverbial phrase: wie bei Hempels unterm Sofa. This phrase is often used to indicate that something is not well cleaned-up -- not dirty, just in its everyday state when one is not expecting visitors. I thought the phrase to be appropriate for this data collection because quite often when listening to the recordings one gets the impression of sitting next to the speaker on the sofa in a common living room.
